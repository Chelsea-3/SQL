#1. Display the patient ID and create a new column that calculates how much each patient still needs to pay. Call the new column payment_remaining.

SELECT patient_id
, procedure_bill - payment_received AS payment_remaining
FROM billing;



#2. Select every patient ID, the procedure bill, and create a new column that calculates the fraction of what the patient has paid toward their procedure bill. Call the new column payment_fraction and sort it from low to high.

SELECT patient_id
,payment_received/procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
FROM billing
ORDER BY payment_fraction;



#3. Display the patient ID, payment_fraction (copy from the previous query), and add a column displaying the percent of the bill that the patient has paid, rounded to one place. Call the new column payment_percent.

SELECT patient_id
,payment_received/procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
,ROUND ((payment_received/procedure_bill)*100, 1) AS payment_percent
FROM billing;



#4.Display the patient ID, the payment_fraction column from query #2, and a new column titled payment_status, which categorizes the payment_fraction column into three categories: For 100% payment, write “paid”. If the payment is less than 100% but more than 0%, use “in progress”. If the patient hasn’t made a payment, write “no payment”.

SELECT patient_id
,payment_received/procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
,CASE 
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) = 1 THEN "paid"
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) = 0 THEN "no payment"
ELSE "in progress"
END AS payment_status
FROM billing;



#5. Alter the previous query to create more categories in payment_status. If someone has paid 100% of their bill, write "paid", if someone has paid 0%, write “no payment”, If the patient has paid 75% or more, write "75%+", Do the same for 50% and 25%, If the number is under 25%, write "Under 25%", name the column payment_status

SELECT patient_id
,payment_received/procedure_bill AS payment_fraction
,CASE 
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) = 1 THEN "paid"
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) = 0 THEN "no payment"
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) >= .75 THEN "75%+"
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) >= .50 THEN "50%+"
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) >= .25 THEN "25%+"
WHEN (payment_received/procedure_bill) <.25 THEN "Under 25%"
END AS payment_status
FROM billing;
